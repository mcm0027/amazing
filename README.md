arbor website


  This site was a project done for a small arbor and outdoor construction business. It was a project I started fairly early in my education and went back to as I learned more CSS techniques. Most copy and image resources were provided by the business. I used Bootstrap as well as media queries to make the site responsive.
            
          
  I used a few JQuery plugins for different aspects of the site: the Animsition plugin provides a fade in and fade out animation on page transitions, the Slick carousel plugin is used for the carousel on the homepage, and,  on the gallery page, the Chocolat lightbox plugin is used to display large versions of each thumbnail. Also, Sticky.js is used to create a fixed navbar effect that has alternate styling upon scrolling down.
